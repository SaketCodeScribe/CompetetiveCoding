    you are given maximum initial energy k (k<1000) and array A of length n denoting wind speed on n days. he is stuck
    on a boat and each day he can either choose to move or stay put. each day he decides to travel he will move ahead
    A[i] Dist and his energy decreases by 1 and if he decides to stay put his energy increases by 1.
    What is the maximum distance he can travel without dropping his energy to negative after n days.
